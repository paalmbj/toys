* SciLife presentation *

- Introduction -

2014 XTen ordered
2015 Jan/Feb - Finished installing

Pipeline time:
3 days bwa on single node

48 nodes on cluster
96 samples per week

Production cluster upgrading
Research cluster storage full 5 PB, want to get a research cluster

FASTQ output towards 1 PB 2015

- LIMS -
Project only samples with one library prep.


LIMS <> noSql DB <> Genomics status
Trello integration!


- NAS -
10 x 1.2 TB 10k SAS
HiSeq X: 0.5 TB / run

Total: ~50 TB 

No sudo rights

NAS have two factor auth, but "functional account".

Scientific linux 6.7. Samba.

LIMS doesn't always pick up the run info.

Event files written to shared filesystem via NAS.

Transfer while the run is going on.
TACA: Various useful tools. Archive data to SweStore. 

SweStore: iRODS. Unstable. Will change to a tape based system (hospital).
Keep data for 16 mo.

Rsync to processing server. Running continuously.

* Transfer sample sheet, event files and interop files to MooseFS.

- Preproc servers - 
3 x Preprocessing, 24 CPU, 24 GB RAM
20 TB / server


TACA processing. Send to cluster.

- Cluster -
QC: fastqscreen, fastqc.
48 nodes 768 cores. 128 GB RAM. 

200 nodes with each 256 GB RAM. 

- Delivery -
Deliver from one user to another. Need functional account.

------------------
File sizes:



HiSeq X:
Higher duplication rates. Lower when loading less.

**Genomics Status**


- NeoPrep- 
Obs: Contamination between samples.
Use for low input samples.

-- Genomics Status --

Old graph type: python server side.
New: Java Script.

- Clinical -

Clinical: separate lab, Shared sequencing room NAS, own preprocessing, cluster.



2500 -> Preprocessing server -> Cluster
X -> Cluster storage -> Demultiplexing

Web interface output visualised for clinicians.

Store BCL for eternity. 
Store result for 2 months. BAM VCF.

- LIMS -

Receive samples.
Sample prep.
QC:
Stops at sequencing. Want it that way + re-queue samples.

Stats tracking: have a DB for demultiplexing stats.

- Scout -
Interpretation interface tool.

Team: 2.5 dev, 2 bioinformatics / IT.
Demultiplexing, alignment+variant calling. Scout.
